Here‚Äôs a well-structured **README.md** for your **Book Management API** project:

# üìö Book Management API

## Overview
The **Book Management API** is a system designed to efficiently manage books, allowing users to add, update, delete, and retrieve book information through API endpoints. It provides structured book storage, supports different book attributes like title, author, genre, and publication year, and ensures smooth data handling.

## üöÄ Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete books effortlessly.
- **RESTful API**: Follows REST principles for easy integration with other services.
- **Database Integration**: Uses a database to store book records securely.
- **Authentication & Security**: Implements user authentication and authorization to protect data.
- **Search & Filters**: Enables users to search for books based on different criteria (author, genre, etc.).
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a growing library of books without performance issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ibn3bbas-sd/Book-Management-API-Project.git
   cd Book-Management-API-Project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   go run .
   ```

## üîó API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/books` | Add a new book |
| `GET` | `/books` | Retrieve all books |
| `GET` | `/books/{id}` | Get a specific book by ID |
| `PUT` | `/books/{id}` | Update book details |
| `DELETE` | `/books/{id}` | Remove a book |

## üîí Authentication
The API uses **JWT-based authentication** to secure endpoints. Users must log in to access protected routes.

## üèóÔ∏è Contributing
Want to contribute? Follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Added new feature"`).
4. Push to GitHub (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.

Sure! Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step guide** on what to do after you‚Äôve compiled and run the Go code:

---

### ‚úÖ **Steps After Executing the Code**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the server**

After saving your Go code (e.g., as `main.go`), open your terminal and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see:

```
Starting server on :8080
```

This means the HTTP server is running on **localhost port 8080**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Test the API using curl or Postman**

---

### üìö **Available Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                   |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | `/books`      | Get all books (as JSON)       |
| GET    | `/books/{id}` | Get a book by ID              |
| POST   | `/books/`     | Create a new book (JSON body) |
| PUT    | `/books/{id}` | Update an existing book       |
| DELETE | `/books/{id}` | Delete a book                 |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Example Requests**

---

‚úÖ **List all books**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/books
```

---

‚úÖ **Add a new book**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/books/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "Go Programming", "author": "John Doe", "published_year": 2024}'
```

You should get back:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Go Programming",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "published_year": 2024
}
```

---

‚úÖ **Get a book by ID**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/books/1
```

---

‚úÖ **Update a book**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/books/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"id": 1, "title": "Advanced Go", "author": "Jane Smith", "published_year": 2025}'
```

---

‚úÖ **Delete a book**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/books/1
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Check responses**

* After each request, the server will respond with:

  * JSON for GET, POST, PUT
  * `204 No Content` for DELETE if successful
  * Proper error messages for invalid cases

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Stop the server**

When you‚Äôre done, press:

```
Ctrl + C
```

in the terminal to stop the Go server.

---

### ‚ö° Optional:

If you want **persistent storage** (right now all books are in-memory and reset when the server restarts), I can help add:
‚úÖ File-based save/load
‚úÖ SQLite or other DB backend
