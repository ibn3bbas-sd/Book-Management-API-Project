## Overview

The **Book Management API** is a lightweight RESTful API written in Go for managing a collection of books.
It allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete book records over HTTP.

⚠ **Current limitations:**

* Data is stored only in-memory (no database, no persistence).
* No authentication or security layer.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Basic CRUD operations
✅ RESTful design
✅ Fast, lightweight Go server

**Planned / Future Enhancements:**

* Database integration (SQLite, Postgres, etc.)
* JWT-based authentication and authorization
* Search, filtering, and pagination
* File uploads (e.g., book cover images)
* Validation and better error handling
* Rate limiting and logging
* Automated unit tests

## 🛠️ Installation & Run

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibn3bbas-sd/Book-Management-API-Project.git
cd Book-Management-API-Project
```

2️⃣ **Install Go dependencies**

```bash
go mod tidy
```

3️⃣ **Run the server**

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see:

```
Starting server on :8080
```

The API is now available at **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**.

## 🔗 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint      | Description               |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| POST   | `/books/`     | Add a new book            |
| GET    | `/books`      | Retrieve all books        |
| GET    | `/books/{id}` | Get a specific book by ID |
| PUT    | `/books/{id}` | Update book details       |
| DELETE | `/books/{id}` | Remove a book             |

---

## 💻 Example Requests (using `curl`)

✅ **List all books**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/books
```

✅ **Add a new book**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/books/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "Go Programming", "author": "John Doe", "published_year": 2024}'
```

✅ **Get a book by ID**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/books/1
```

✅ **Update a book**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/books/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"id": 1, "title": "Advanced Go", "author": "Jane Smith", "published_year": 2025}'
```

✅ **Delete a book**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/books/1
```

---

## 📦 Responses

* **Success (GET, POST, PUT)** → returns JSON with book data
* **Success (DELETE)** → returns `204 No Content`
* **Errors** → returns proper HTTP status codes + error messages
