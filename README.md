# 📚 Book Management API

## Overview
The **Book Management API** is a system designed to efficiently manage books, allowing users to add, update, delete, and retrieve book information through API endpoints. It provides structured book storage, supports different book attributes like title, author, genre, and publication year, and ensures smooth data handling.

## 🚀 Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete books effortlessly.
- **RESTful API**: Follows REST principles for easy integration with other services.
- **Database Integration**: Uses a database to store book records securely.
- **Authentication & Security**: Implements user authentication and authorization to protect data.
- **Search & Filters**: Enables users to search for books based on different criteria (author, genre, etc.).
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a growing library of books without performance issues.
